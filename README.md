# Video_Activity_Recognition
This project implements Video Activity Recognition using two different models:
1)ConvLSTM Network
2)Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN), which combines CNN and LSTM layers in a single model.
The latter is a better network in recognizing the video activity based on a predefined set of activities upon which the model is trained.
The user can use any YouTube video along with providing the timestamp of the specific activity which needs to be recognized.
It was prepared on Google Colab thus the py file is best recommended to be opened using the same service.
